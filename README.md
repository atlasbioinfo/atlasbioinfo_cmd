# Atlas Bioinformatics Toolkit

Atlas is a comprehensive bioinformatics toolkit designed to streamline various genomic analysis tasks. This collection of Python scripts and utilities provides a robust set of tools for processing and analysing genomic data.

## Features

- BAM file processing and indexing
- FASTQ quality control
- Coverage and reactivity calculations
- AWS S3 file downloading
- SAM to BAM conversion
- Large file management
- RNA-seq data analysis

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/atlas-bioinformatics-toolkit.git
   ```

2. Set up the Conda environment:
   ```
   mamba install python=3.11
   mamba install -c bioconda bowtie2 hisat2 samtools
   ```

3. Activate the environment:
   ```
   conda activate ATLAS
   ```

## Usage

The main entry point for Atlas is the `atlas` script. It provides access to various subcommands:

```
python atlas [command] [options]
```

Available commands:

- `sam2bam`: Convert SAM files to BAM format
- `bamindex`: Index BAM files
- `check_big_file`: Identify and optionally compress large files
- `dmsmap`: Process DMS-MaP data
- `cov_rt_count`: Calculate coverage and RT counts
- `fastqc`: Perform quality control on FASTQ files

For detailed usage of each command, use the `-h` or `--help` option:

```
python atlas [command] -h
```

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains important configuration settings, such as the path to the local Python interpreter. Ensure this file is properly set up before running Atlas commands.

## File Structure

- `atlas`: Main entry script
- `commands/`: Directory containing individual command scripts
- `environment.yml`: Conda environment specification
- `config.json`: Configuration file
- `LICENSE`: MIT License file

## Examples

1. Convert SAM to BAM:
   ```
   python atlas sam2bam -s /path/to/samtools -t 8
   ```

2. Calculate coverage:
   ```
   python atlas cov_rt_count input.bam -o output.AtlasCovRT
   ```

3. Download files from AWS S3:
   ```
   python atlas aws_autodownload -c config_file.txt -l ./local_directory
   ```
